# Endgame - A Team Blunder Project

## <img src="https://cdn.iconscout.com/icon/free/png-256/idea-1618744-1372450.png" width="32" height="32"> Abstract
The process of learning is never easy and especially when you dislike the subject you are trying to learn. No matter how confident you are with your preparation for exams, it is during the eleventh hour that most of the studying, revising and maybe mugging up takes place. Students find it difficult to quickly revise theoretical subjects especially those pertaining to social studies like History and Geography or sciences like Botany and many more, given the amount of time they have and the vast theory that they have to cover.

This eleventh hour revising process is what we aim to simplify. The main objective of our project is to make revising the text simpler and faster without compromising with the textual content and taxing the student’s brain. The secondary objective also involves reaching out to the economically weaker sections of the society which may not be able to afford learning materials such as digests or solution booklets, etc as well as to those who aren’t affluent with English, via this project.

In today’s world smartphones have become a necessity and this has opened the door to a plethora of solutions to reinvent technology based learning. Using smartphones one can have easy access to the internet and all the features that come along with it. It can be possible that most people might not own PCs but it is really rare that someone doesn’t own a smartphone these days. Thus, we decided to deploy our project in the form of an app making it accessible to all the sections of the society. We would also be using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models to execute certain tasks within the app, about which we would be covering in a moment. By just taking a picture of their text (or uploading a image or PDF of the same) students can easily get short notes in point forms using which they can easily revise the topic and also will be able to attempt an optional short quiz of about 5 one word question answers which will be generated based on the text so that he/she can be confident about what he/she has studied.

Some may argue that the student may use online tools to accomplish these tasks or even use the notes that are readily available online. The main problem is that the notes may be available online in plenty for central boards such as the ICSE or CBSE, but not for some state boards. Also, it may take intense searching to find some good notes online which sometimes may turn out to be paid. Apart from these, the novelty that we are trying to implement in this is that, the app won’t just give out the summarized text but it would also display some images and 3D models related to that text too so that the student gets the complete information about what he or she is revising. The main keywords will be highlighted too and their positions in the text will be shown in case of documents.

1. The user scans the text or uploads a document related to the concept he/she is studying.
2. The app captures the image/document and identifies the text in it.
3. Using machine learning algorithms, the app detects the keywords present in the detected text and thus predicts the concept that the user is studying.
4. Another machine learning algorithm will summarize the entire text and get it into point form and also prepare questions based on the same, which will be displayed to the user.
5. Using web scraping algorithms, the app will extract the most relevant images and models using the keywords in the text, from the internet and display it to the user in along with the summarised text.
6. Finally, once the user has finished reading he or she can attempt a short quiz based on the text if he or she wishes to.

The app, for now, runs on a cloud-based system i.e one has to be connected to the internet to even use the summarizing feature. In the future, we plan to embed these models into the app. We are also planning on adding a translation feature since the best materials for competitive exams are in English and as some of those exams such as the JEE are being conducted in different Indian languages from 2021. This will help in narrowing the language barrier between the student and knowledge. Starting with the aim to simplify last minute revisions we are going to make the project beneficial not only to last minute revisers but to anyone in pursuit in knowledge, trying to overcome all the barriers in the way.

## Note
The repository may be committed several times in order update the URL of the model present in ChoiceActivity.java file, since it is hosted on a localhost server whose URL refreshes every two hours.
